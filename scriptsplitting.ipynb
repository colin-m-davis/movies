    "* Notice that within the quotations (`''`) there are two parenthetical groups: `([A-Z]+ [A-Z]+|[A-Z]+)` and `(.*)`. The first group captures the name and the second captures everything else. This allows us to later split these into the keys and values of the dictionary.\n",
    "* The part `^([A-Z]+ [A-Z]+` searches for a string of characters that starts with a string of capital letters of any length (`[A-Z]+`), a space character, and another string of capital letters of any length (`[A-Z]+`). The character `^` means \"starts with\". \n",
    "* The character `|` means either/or, so `^([A-Z]+ [A-Z]+|[A-Z]+)` all together means \"starts with two words in all caps or starts with one word in all caps\". \n",
    "* Finally the `(.*)` can be interpreted as \"any character (`.`) of any length (`*`)\". Normally, this doesn't include newlines and will stop once it hits a newline, but the argument `re.S` passed in the function makes it so that it includes newlines as part of \"any character\". Since the script is already split by paragraph, it will just capture everything in the paragraph chunk after the name.\n"
